## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a recruiter or hiring manager viewing the Job Page, I want to see each candidate's location and experience when matching candidates to a job, so I can make informed decisions quickly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a job with matching candidates, **When** viewing the candidate cards, **Then** each card displays the candidate's location and experience.
2. **Given** a candidate without location or experience data, **When** viewing the card, **Then** the card displays a clear indication that the information is missing (e.g., "Not provided").

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a candidate has only one of the two fields (location or experience)?
- How does the system handle candidates with invalid or ambiguous location/experience data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow storage of candidate location and experience data.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display candidate location and experience on the candidate card in the job matching view.
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle and display a clear message when location or experience is missing for a candidate.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow updating or adding location and experience information for existing candidates.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure that location and experience data is available via the API used by the frontend job matching view.
- **FR-006**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What format should experience be in? (e.g., years, months, text description?)]
- **FR-007**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is location a city, region, country, or free text?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Candidate**: Represents a job applicant. Key attributes: name, location [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: format], experience [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: format], skills, etc.
- **Job**: Represents a job posting. Key attributes: title, required experience, required location, etc.
