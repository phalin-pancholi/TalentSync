# Feature Specification: Integrate Zoho People Plus Data

**Feature Branch**: `009-integrate-zoho-people`
**Created**: September 23, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Integrate Zoho People Plus data into the application. Use the existing Zoho access token to call https://people.zoho.in/people/api/forms/P_EmployeeView/records and retrieve all employees. Create a new service that syncs Zoho employee data at a specified interval. For each employee, send their data to the LLM to generate candidate details."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Application, Zoho People Plus, LLM, Candidate
   → Actions: Sync employee data, Retrieve employees, Generate candidate details
   → Data: Zoho employee records, Candidate details
   → Constraints: Sync interval, Zoho API access token
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the required sync interval?] : 5 minutes
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What should happen if Zoho API call fails?] : log the error & skip
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should errors in LLM candidate generation be handled?] : log the error & skip
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What fields from Zoho employee data are required for candidate details?]: All
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there a limit on number of employees processed per sync?]: 50
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should candidate details be updated or only created if new?]: Only create if new skip existing employees
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
5. Generate Functional Requirements
6. Identify Key Entities
7. Run Review Checklist
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
An admin configures the application to sync employee data from Zoho People Plus. At the specified interval, the application retrieves all employee records from Zoho, sends each employee's data to the LLM, and generates candidate details for use in the application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is configured with a valid Zoho access token and sync interval, **When** the sync service runs, **Then** all employee records from Zoho are retrieved and candidate details are generated via LLM.
2. **Given** an employee record is missing required fields, **When** the sync service processes it, **Then** the system logs the error and continues processing other records.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Zoho API is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does the system handle rate limits or large numbers of employees?
- What if the LLM fails to generate candidate details for an employee?
- How are duplicate or updated employee records managed?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow configuration of Zoho access token and sync interval.
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve all employee records from Zoho People Plus using the provided API endpoint.
- **FR-003**: System MUST process each employee record and send it to the LLM to generate candidate details.
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle errors in API calls and LLM processing gracefully, logging issues and continuing where possible.
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist generated candidate details for use in the application.
- **FR-006**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specify which fields from Zoho employee data are required for candidate details]
- **FR-007**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define update vs. create logic for candidate details]
- **FR-008**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specify maximum number of employees processed per sync, if any]

### Key Entities
- **Employee Record**: Represents an individual employee as retrieved from Zoho People Plus. Key attributes: employee ID, name, contact info, job title, department, etc.
- **Candidate Details**: Represents the output generated by the LLM for each employee. Key attributes: candidate profile, skills, experience, summary, etc.
- **Sync Service**: Manages periodic retrieval and processing of employee data.
