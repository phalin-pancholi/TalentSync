# Feature Specification: Add More Candidate Detail Functionality

**Feature Branch**: `005-add-more-candidate`  
**Created**: September 22, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add more candidate detail functionality. On candidate card there should be button to upload text document which should be store in db as extra details. the data can be interview feedback, new skills, work summary etc. These details should be stored as it is. You have to read that uploaded document (pdf, text) and only store it text data in db. Do not store uploaded document in file system. The button should be available only on candidate card. Do not modify existing screens."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts: candidate card, upload button, text document, extra details, database storage, document types (pdf, text), data types (feedback, skills, summary), UI constraint (button only on candidate card), do not modify other screens, do not store file in filesystem.
3. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a limit on document size or type?]
4. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Who can upload these documents? Any user or only certain roles?]
5. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
6. Generate Functional Requirements
7. Identify Key Entities (Candidate, CandidateExtraDetail)
8. Run Review Checklist
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user viewing a candidate card wants to add more details about the candidate (such as interview feedback, new skills, or work summary) by uploading a text or PDF document. The system extracts the text from the uploaded document and stores it as extra details for the candidate in the database. The uploaded file itself is not stored.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is viewing a candidate card, **When** they click the "Upload Details" button and select a valid text or PDF document, **Then** the system extracts the text and stores it as extra details for the candidate in the database.
2. **Given** a user uploads a document with interview feedback, **When** the upload is successful, **Then** the feedback is visible as extra details for that candidate.
3. **Given** a user attempts to upload a non-text or non-PDF file, **When** the upload is rejected, **Then** the user is notified of the allowed file types.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user uploads a very large document?: set max limit to 5MB.
- How does the system handle corrupted or unreadable files?
- What if the extracted text is empty?
- How are duplicate uploads handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload a text or PDF document as extra details for a candidate from the candidate card.
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract and store only the text content from the uploaded document in the database as extra details for the candidate.
- **FR-003**: System MUST NOT store the uploaded document file in the file system.
- **FR-004**: The upload button MUST be available only on the candidate card and MUST NOT appear on other screens.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support storing multiple types of extra details (e.g., interview feedback, new skills, work summary) as plain text.
- **FR-006**: System MUST reject uploads of unsupported file types (anything other than .txt or .pdf) and notify the user.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle errors gracefully if the document cannot be read or text cannot be extracted.
- **FR-008**: Maximum document size for upload MUST be limited to 5MB.
- **FR-009**: No such requirement identified.

### Key Entities
- **Candidate**: Represents an individual whose details are being managed. Key attributes: id, name, existing details, extra details (list of text entries).
- **CandidateExtraDetail**: Represents an extra detail entry for a candidate. Key attributes: id, candidate_id, text_content, type (feedback, skills, summary, etc.), created_at.
