## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A recruiter or hiring manager views a candidate card and wants to generate a professional profile summary in PDF format. By clicking the "Generate Profile Summary" button, the system collects all available candidate data (structured, unstructured, feedback), sends it along with a summary template to an LLM, and returns a generated PDF profile summary for download or sharing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a candidate card is displayed, **When** the user clicks the "Generate Profile Summary" button, **Then** the system generates and provides a downloadable PDF profile summary based on the candidate's data.
2. **Given** incomplete or missing candidate data, **When** the user attempts to generate a profile summary, **Then** the system should handle missing fields gracefully and still generate a summary, possibly with placeholders or omissions.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the LLM service is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does the system handle very large or unstructured candidate data?
- What if the candidate has no feedback or only partial data?
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should users be notified if some data is missing from the summary?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "Generate Profile Summary" button on each candidate card.
- **FR-002**: System MUST collect all candidate data (structured, unstructured, feedback) when generating the summary.
- **FR-003**: System MUST send candidate data and a profile summary template to an LLM for summary generation.
- **FR-004**: System MUST receive and render the generated profile summary as a PDF document.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to download the generated PDF summary.
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle errors from the LLM service and notify the user appropriately.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle missing or incomplete candidate data gracefully in the summary output.
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure that only authorized users can generate and access profile summaries. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the user roles/permissions?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST log all profile summary generation events for audit purposes. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What details should be logged?]

### Key Entities
- **Candidate**: Represents an individual whose profile summary is being generated. Attributes include structured data (name, experience, education), unstructured data (resume text), and feedback.
- **Profile Summary**: The generated document containing a synthesized overview of the candidate, formatted per the provided template.
- **User**: The actor (recruiter, hiring manager) initiating the summary generation. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there other user types?]
