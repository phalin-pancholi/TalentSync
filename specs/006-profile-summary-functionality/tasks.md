### ✅ T002. [Setup] Review and document existing PDF generation approach
- ✅ Confirmed existing packages for text-based PDF generation (using built-in capabilities)
- ✅ Documented limitations and implemented text-based approach
- ✅ File(s): backend/src/services/document_service.py, research.md

### ✅ T003. [Test] Write contract test for LLM summary generation [P]
- ✅ Created comprehensive contract tests that mock Gemini LLM API call and validate summary output structure
- ✅ File(s): backend/tests/contract/test_documents.py

### ✅ T004. [Test] Write integration test for end-to-end profile summary flow [P]
- ✅ Implemented full integration tests simulating button click, backend LLM call, and PDF download
- ✅ File(s): backend/tests/integration/test_candidate_extra_details.py

### ✅ T005. [Model] Update candidate data model to support all required fields [P]
- ✅ Verified candidate model includes all necessary fields (structured, unstructured, feedback)
- ✅ Model already supported required fields for summary generation
- ✅ File(s): backend/src/models/candidate.py

### ✅ T006. [Service] Implement Gemini LLM integration in backend service
- ✅ Added `generate_profile_summary` method to LLMExtractionService
- ✅ Handles candidate data and feedback aggregation
- ✅ Includes comprehensive error handling for timeouts and malformed responses
- ✅ File(s): backend/src/services/llm_extraction_service.py

### ✅ T007. [Service] Update PDF generation logic to use summary from LLM
- ✅ Implemented `generate_profile_summary_pdf` method in DocumentService
- ✅ Handles missing/incomplete data gracefully using text-based PDF approach
- ✅ File(s): backend/src/services/document_service.py

### ✅ T008. [API] Add/Update endpoint to trigger profile summary generation
- ✅ Added `POST /api/candidates/{candidate_id}/profile-summary` endpoint
- ✅ Collects all candidate data, calls LLM, and returns PDF
- ✅ Includes proper authorization and error handling
- ✅ File(s): backend/src/api/candidates.py

### ✅ T009. [Frontend] Add "Generate Profile Summary" button to candidate card
- ✅ Added purple download button with loading states
- ✅ Triggers API call and handles PDF download automatically
- ✅ Shows appropriate error/success notifications
- ✅ File(s): frontend/src/components/Candidates.js

### ✅ T010. [Integration] Add logging for profile summary generation events
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for user actions, success/failure, and errors
- ✅ Logs candidate identification and timing information for audit trails
- ✅ File(s): backend/src/services/llm_extraction_service.py, backend/src/api/candidates.py

### ✅ T011. [Polish] Add unit tests for new backend logic [P]
- ✅ Created extensive unit tests for profile summary generation in LLM service
- ✅ Added unit tests for PDF generation functionality
- ✅ File(s): backend/tests/unit/test_llm_extraction.py, backend/tests/unit/test_services.py

### ✅ T012. [Polish] Add frontend unit tests for button and API integration [P]
- ✅ Comprehensive React component tests for button behavior
- ✅ Tests for loading states, error handling, and file download functionality
- ✅ File(s): frontend/src/components/__tests__/Candidates.test.js

### ✅ T013. [Polish] Update documentation and create quickstart guide
- ✅ Created comprehensive quickstart guide with examples and troubleshooting
- ✅ Updated main README.md with new feature documentation
- ✅ File(s): specs/006-profile-summary-functionality/quickstart.md, README.md

## ✅ Implementation Summary

All 13 tasks have been successfully completed. The profile summary functionality is fully implemented with:

- **Backend**: Complete API endpoint with LLM integration and PDF generation
- **Frontend**: User-friendly button with loading states and error handling  
- **Testing**: Comprehensive contract, integration, and unit test coverage
- **Documentation**: Full quickstart guide and API documentation
- **Constraints Met**: No new packages installed, using only existing dependencies

## ✅ Validation Complete

- ✅ All contract tests pass
- ✅ Integration tests validate end-to-end flow
- ✅ Unit tests cover edge cases and error scenarios  
- ✅ Frontend tests ensure proper UI behavior
- ✅ Documentation provides clear usage instructions
- ✅ Feature is ready for production use

The profile summary functionality is now fully operational and meets all specified requirements while adhering to the "no new packages" constraint.
