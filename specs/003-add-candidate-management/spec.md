# Feature Specification: Candidate Management and Navigation Update

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-candidate-management`  
**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add similar functionality like jobs page. 1. Create a separate page for candidate 2. Provide option to create a candidate via html form or by uploading document 3. Store both structured and text data in database. 4. Provide all CURD operation. On the main screen remove home button and replace it with job button. provide candidate button beside to it."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user can manage candidates in the system through a dedicated page, including creating new candidates (via form or document upload), viewing, updating, and deleting candidate records. The main navigation provides direct access to both jobs and candidates.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the main screen, **When** the user views the navigation bar, **Then** the Home button is replaced by a Job button and a Candidate button is present beside it.
2. **Given** the candidate page, **When** the user submits a new candidate via form, **Then** the candidate is created and visible in the list.
3. **Given** the candidate page, **When** the user uploads a candidate document, **Then** the system extracts and stores both structured and text data for the candidate.
4. **Given** a list of candidates, **When** the user selects a candidate, **Then** they can view, update, or delete the candidate's information.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the uploaded document is in an unsupported format? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What file types are supported for candidate upload?]
- How does the system handle duplicate candidate entries? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should duplicates be allowed, merged, or rejected?]
- What validation is required for candidate data fields? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Required fields and validation rules for candidate creation?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a dedicated candidate management page accessible from the main navigation.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to create a candidate via an HTML form.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to create a candidate by uploading a document.
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract and store both structured and text data from uploaded candidate documents.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for candidate records.
- **FR-006**: System MUST update the main navigation to replace the Home button with a Job button and add a Candidate button beside it.
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate candidate data on creation and update. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the required fields and validation rules?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle unsupported file types gracefully during candidate upload. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What file types are supported?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST define behavior for duplicate candidate entries. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should duplicates be allowed, merged, or rejected?]

### Key Entities
- **Candidate**: Represents an individual candidate, including structured data (e.g., name, contact info, skills) and unstructured text data (e.g., resume text).
- **Document**: Represents an uploaded file associated with a candidate, used for extracting candidate information.
