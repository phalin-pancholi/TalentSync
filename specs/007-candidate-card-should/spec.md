# Feature Specification: Cleaner Candidate Card UI

**Feature Branch**: `007-candidate-card-should`  
**Created**: September 23, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Candidate card should show minimal details like name, skill, experience etc not all data. It will give more cleaner look. And add button show all details on each card. Make it cleaner and nicer."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user viewing a list of candidates, I want each candidate card to display only essential information (such as name, key skills, and experience), so that the interface is cleaner and easier to scan. If I want to see more details, I can click a button to expand the card and view all candidate information.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a list of candidate cards, **When** the user views the page, **Then** each card shows only minimal details (name, skills, experience).
2. **Given** a candidate card, **When** the user clicks the "Show all details" button, **Then** the card expands (or a modal appears) to show all available candidate information.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a candidate is missing one of the minimal details (e.g., no skills listed)?
- How does the system handle very long skill or experience lists?
- What if there are no candidates to display?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display only minimal candidate details (name, skills, experience) on each candidate card by default.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a "Show all details" button on each candidate card.
- **FR-003**: System MUST display all candidate details when the user clicks the "Show all details" button.
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure the candidate card layout is visually clean and easy to scan.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle cases where some minimal details are missing gracefully (e.g., show placeholder or hide field).
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle long lists of skills or experience without breaking the card layout.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle the case where there are no candidates to display.

### Key Entities
- **Candidate Card**: Represents a summary view of a candidate, showing minimal details (name, skills, experience) and a button to expand for more information.
- **Candidate**: Represents an individual with attributes such as name, skills, experience, and other details.
