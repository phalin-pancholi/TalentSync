# Implementation Plan: Modular Python Backend Architecture

**Branch**: `001-update-an-backend` | **Date**: September 18, 2025 | **Spec**: /specs/001-update-an-backend/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-update-an-backend/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Refactor the backend API service to a modular, maintainable Python architecture. Use a clear folder structure (`models/`, `services/`, `api/`, `utils/`, `tests/`). Each module has a single responsibility. FastAPI, Pydantic, and Motor are primary dependencies. MongoDB is used for persistence. Contract and integration tests are defined before implementation. No constitution violations identified.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Pydantic, Motor, python-dotenv  
**Storage**: MongoDB  
**Testing**: pytest, FastAPI TestClient  
**Target Platform**: Linux server  
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend)  
**Performance Goals**: Maintain or improve current API performance  
**Constraints**: Modular, maintainable, testable codebase  
**Scale/Scope**: Growing codebase, multiple developers

## Constitution Check
See `/specs/001-update-an-backend/contracts/constitution-check.md` for details. No violations at this stage.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
See `research.md` for details and open clarifications.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
See `data-model.md`, `contracts/openapi.yaml`, and `contracts/test_jobs.py` for design and contract details.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
- Tasks will be generated from contracts, data model, and quickstart.
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before API
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

## Complexity Tracking
None identified at this stage.

## Progress Tracking
**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [ ] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
