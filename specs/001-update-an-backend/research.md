# Research for Modular Python Backend Architecture

## Unknowns and Clarifications
- Should there be a common utilities module for shared logic? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Is backward compatibility required for all endpoints? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- What are the preferred logging and error handling standards for this project? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Best Practices for Python Modular Backend
- Use a clear folder structure: `models/`, `services/`, `api/`, `utils/`, `tests/`.
- Each module should have a single responsibility and minimal dependencies.
- Use FastAPI for API layer, Pydantic for models, and Motor for async MongoDB access.
- Centralize configuration and environment management.
- Use dependency injection for services and database connections.
- Place shared logic in a `utils/` or `common/` module.
- Document module responsibilities and interfaces.

## Decision: Adopt Option 2 (Web Application Structure)
- Place backend code in `backend/` with subfolders: `src/models/`, `src/services/`, `src/api/`, `src/utils/`.
- Place tests in `backend/tests/`.
- Use FastAPI, Pydantic, Motor as primary dependencies.

## Rationale
- This structure supports separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.
- Aligns with Python and FastAPI community best practices.
- Makes onboarding and feature addition easier.

## Alternatives Considered
- Single flat file/module: Not scalable for growing codebase.
- Option 1 (single src/): Less clear separation for web projects with frontend/backend.
- Option 3 (mobile+api): Not relevant for current project scope.

## Next Steps
- Resolve open clarifications with stakeholders.
- Proceed to data model and contract design based on this structure.
