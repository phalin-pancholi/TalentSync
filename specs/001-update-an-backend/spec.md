# Feature Specification: Update Backend API Service Architecture for Modularity and Readability

**Feature Branch**: `001-update-an-backend`  
**Created**: September 18, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Update an backend api service architecture. Make it more moduler and redable."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a backend developer or maintainer, I want the API service codebase to be organized into clear, modular components so that it is easier to read, maintain, and extend.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an existing monolithic backend API service, **When** the architecture is refactored, **Then** the codebase is organized into logical modules (e.g., routes, models, services) with clear separation of concerns.
2. **Given** a new developer joins the team, **When** they review the backend code, **Then** they can easily understand the structure and responsibilities of each module.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a new feature needs to be added? [Should be easy to add in a modular structure]
- How does the system handle shared logic or dependencies between modules? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a common utilities module?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST organize backend API code into distinct modules based on functionality (e.g., routing, data models, business logic).
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure each module has a clear, single responsibility.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide clear documentation or structure so new developers can onboard quickly.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow for easy addition of new features or endpoints without major refactoring.
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain or improve current API functionality and performance after refactor.
- **FR-006**: System MUST define clear interfaces for communication between modules.
- **FR-007**: System MUST avoid code duplication by centralizing shared logic.
- **FR-008**: System MUST include error handling and logging in a consistent, modular way.
- **FR-009**: System MUST NOT introduce breaking changes to existing API consumers unless explicitly communicated. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is backward compatibility required for all endpoints?]

### Key Entities
- **Module**: Represents a logical grouping of related code (e.g., job routes, candidate models, database services).
- **Route**: Defines an API endpoint and its handler logic.
- **Model**: Represents the structure of data entities (e.g., JobPosting, Candidate).
- **Service**: Encapsulates business logic and interactions with data sources.
