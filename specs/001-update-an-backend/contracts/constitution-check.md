# Constitution Check for Modular Python Backend

## Initial Constitution Check
- Library-First: Each module (models, services, api, utils) will be self-contained and independently testable.
- CLI Interface: Not directly applicable, but API endpoints will be documented and testable via OpenAPI.
- Test-First: Contract and integration tests are defined before implementation.
- Integration Testing: Contract tests for API endpoints and integration tests for service interactions will be included.
- Observability: Logging and error handling will be centralized and structured.
- Simplicity: Folder structure and module responsibilities are kept simple and clear.

## Violations
- None identified at this stage. All principles are satisfied by the proposed modular structure and test-first approach.

---

## Post-Design Constitution Check
- To be updated after Phase 1 design is complete.
