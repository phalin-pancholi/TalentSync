# Feature Specification: LLM-based Job Upload Endpoint

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-llm-based`  
**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add llm based endpoint to backend service. From frontend user will upload a job description document which may be in pdf or text format. Using llm service will that document and Populate a job structure and create a job entry in the database. If some field of the structure are empty allow them to entered as None value do not stop them."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user uploads a job description document (PDF or text) via the frontend. The backend receives the document, uses an LLM service to extract job information, populates a job structure, and creates a job entry in the database. If some fields are missing, they are set to None and do not block the process.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid job description document (PDF or text), **When** the user uploads it, **Then** the system extracts job details and creates a job entry in the database, allowing missing fields to be None.
2. **Given** a job description document with missing or ambiguous fields, **When** the user uploads it, **Then** the system creates a job entry with None for those fields and does not reject the upload.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the uploaded document is not a valid PDF or text file? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the system reject or attempt to process?]
- How does the system handle documents with no extractable job information? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should an empty job entry be created or should the user be notified?]
- What if the LLM service is unavailable? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the upload fail or be retried?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload job description documents in PDF or text format.
- **FR-002**: System MUST use an LLM service to extract job information from the uploaded document.
- **FR-003**: System MUST populate a job structure with the extracted information.
- **FR-004**: System MUST create a job entry in the database using the populated job structure.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow fields in the job structure to be None if information is missing from the document.
- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT reject uploads solely due to missing fields in the job structure.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle unsupported file types gracefully. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the expected behavior?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide feedback to the user on the status of the upload and job creation. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What level of detail is required?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST log all upload and extraction events for traceability.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Job Description Document**: Represents the uploaded file containing job details. Attributes: file type, file content, upload timestamp, uploader.
- **Job Structure**: Represents the extracted job information. Attributes: title, description, requirements, location, salary, etc. (fields may be None if missing).
- **Job Entry**: Represents the database record created from the job structure.
