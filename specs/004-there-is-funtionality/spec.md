# Feature Specification: Candidate Document LLM Extraction and Storage

**Feature Branch**: `004-there-is-funtionality`  
**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "There is funtionality chaneg in cadidate page. Instead of storing candidate documents Read them and pass them to llm. llm will populate candidate structure and store it in database. You also need to store that raw text data in monogo db for futures perspective. Allow to save the data if some fields aremissing. I want the same funtionality like job page have. Simple."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user uploads a candidate document (e.g., resume) on the candidate page. The system reads the document, extracts its text, and sends it to an LLM. The LLM returns a structured candidate profile, which is saved to the database. The raw text from the document is also stored in MongoDB for future reference. If some candidate fields are missing, the system still allows saving the candidate profile.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user uploads a candidate document, **When** the document is processed, **Then** the system MUST extract text, send it to the LLM, and store both the structured candidate data and raw text in the database.
2. **Given** a candidate document with missing fields, **When** the LLM returns an incomplete profile, **Then** the system MUST allow saving the candidate with missing fields.
3. **Given** a user uploads a document, **When** the system processes it, **Then** the raw text MUST be stored in MongoDB for future use.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the document is unreadable or corrupt? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the system reject, notify the user, or allow manual entry?]
- How does the system handle LLM extraction failures? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should it retry, notify the user, or allow manual entry?]
- What if the same document is uploaded multiple times? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should duplicates be detected or allowed?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST read and extract text from candidate documents upon upload.
- **FR-002**: System MUST send extracted text to an LLM to generate a structured candidate profile.
- **FR-003**: System MUST store the structured candidate profile in the database, even if some fields are missing.
- **FR-004**: System MUST store the raw extracted text from the document in MongoDB for future reference.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide the same user experience and flow as the job page for document processing and saving.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow saving candidate data even if some fields are missing after LLM extraction.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle unreadable or corrupt documents gracefully. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific error handling behavior]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle LLM extraction failures gracefully. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific error handling behavior]
- **FR-009**: System MUST address duplicate document uploads. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should duplicates be detected or allowed?]

### Key Entities
- **Candidate Document**: Represents the uploaded file containing candidate information (e.g., resume, CV). Attributes: file, extracted text, upload timestamp, associated candidate.
- **Candidate Profile**: Structured data returned by the LLM, representing the candidate's details (name, contact, skills, etc.), may have missing fields.
- **Raw Text Data**: The plain text extracted from the candidate document, stored in MongoDB for future use.
